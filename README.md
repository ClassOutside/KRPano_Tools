# KRPano_Tools

A collection of general-purpose tools, scripts, and updates I use with the KRPano 360 Tour Editor.  
This repository serves as a personal store of reusable components that make building and customizing KRPano tours faster and easier.

## circular_hotspots

The `circular_hotspots` folder contains the `circle_hotspots` plugin file, modified to support 3D transitions within KRPano and optional logging updates.  
The original `circle_hotspots` plugin is by Luis Erantzcani and can be found here:
